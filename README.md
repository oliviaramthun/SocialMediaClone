# SocialMediaClone
A twitter-esque clone in Java using classes, lists, and packages to create relationships between user data.
This was a project I created to demonstrate my implimentation of a new language learned, Java! 
User is displayed a profile, and displays their "timeline" of posts based on their profiles followimg list.
User is also displayed a suggested "timeline" for the profiles they do not follow, but their followers follow. 
Based on line 221 in profile_class.java " loggedInUser = CurrentUsers.get(3); " programmer can adjust the logged in profile by adjusting the number between 1 and 7.
